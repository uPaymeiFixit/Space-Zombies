HTML5 / JavaScript Practice / Games

An old draft of a simple zombie-style 2D game using an HTML5 Canvas. Used often to test my multiplayer libraries using Socket.io.

I wrote this draft to help my friend get started with one of his games. This is one of the games I use to test different multiplayer configurations using Socket.io and Node.js. The player is the green dot that is in the center of the screen, and can move around by moving the mouse or tilting the device. The object of the game is to avoid touching any of the zombie-like enemy. The player can hold down the mouse button to shoot and kill enemy.

### Controls
**Move mouse / tilt device:** Move player
**Click:** Toggle firing
